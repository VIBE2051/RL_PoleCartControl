# RL_PoleCartControl
Controlling an inverted pendulum using reinforcement learning

## OpenAI Gymnasium environment
For this project I used OpenAI's gymlibrary at https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/

The cart is attached to an un-actuated joint on the cart, that moves along a frictionless surface. The goal is to balance the pendulum by moving the cart left or right.
